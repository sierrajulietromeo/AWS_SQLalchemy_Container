Architecture Flow:

1. Developer builds Docker image locally and pushes to Amazon ECR
2. ECS Task Definition references the ECR image
3. ECS Service runs tasks based on the Task Definition
4. Internet users can access the application either:
   a. Directly via ECS tasks with public IPs, or
   b. Through an optional Application Load Balancer
5. ECS tasks connect to RDS PostgreSQL database (if configured)

AWS Components:
- Amazon ECR: Stores the Docker image for the Flask application
- Amazon ECS (Fargate): Runs the containerised application
- Application Load Balancer (Optional): Routes traffic to the ECS tasks
- Amazon RDS (Optional): PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- VPC with public and private subnets (not shown in diagram)
- Security Groups (not shown in diagram)
